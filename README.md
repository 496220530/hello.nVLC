# hello.nVLC

A minimal WPF media player comparing [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), [Windows Media Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player) and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) using
[nVLC](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nVLC/), [VLC.Native](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VLC.Native/) and [FontAwesome.Sharp](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FontAwesome.Sharp/).

Actually, the VLC dependency package is quite big, so maybe the player is not so minimalistic altogether.
